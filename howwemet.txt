How we met

We may have been worlds apart, but our paths crossed in the most modern way, social media. Because when two people are meant to be, the algorithm doesn’t stand a chance.
Ijay came on Eno’s For you page, proving that scrolling does really change your life.

We began chatting around November 2022. At the time, Eno was living in Nigeria, while Ijay was in Canada, and by pure coincidence (or divine planning), Ijay was already planning a Christmas trip to Nigeria, a trip that would soon mean much more. What started on TikTok soon moved to WhatsApp, and thats where the connection picked up

Our conversations were filled with curiosity and lots of questions.. We spoke about life as it was and life as we hoped it would become. About love, faith, values, and the kind of future we envisioned. Being worlds apart required intention. So it was really coming down to understanding the type of persons we are. 

From sparked interest to faith bringing us to the same timeline, we met in Nigeria for the first time in December 2022. From there, it didn’t take long to realize this was something special and from the day we chose each other, Feb 28, 2023, we began walking toward the same future.

The Proposal
From the very first day I met Ijay, my life shifted in a way I couldn’t explain. I had never met someone so gentle, so intentional, so genuinely pure of heart. Loving her felt certain, like something my soul recognized long before I understood it myself.
I planned the trip to London with intention, knowing it would be more than just another getaway for us. I carried the weight of what I wanted to say the entire journey, rehearsing words that could never fully capture what she means to me. Still, I knew I had to try.
In the middle of the city, during a paint and sip, surrounded by colors, laughter, and the quiet comfort that comes from being with your person, I finally spoke. I told her how she had changed me, how distance had only made my love grow deeper, and how life with her felt honest and safe and full. I told her that loving her had become my favorite place to be.
Then I asked her to be mine forever.
It wasn’t just a question, it was a promise. To choose her daily, to grow with her, to keep learning love together, and to continue walking toward the future we had already begun building. In that moment, I wasn’t stepping into something unknown, I was choosing the life I knew I wanted ..with her.
And she said yes.

The journey
The journey has been delightful to say the least. We have our up and downs but we stay riding. We say to each other how the distance has been a blessing in disguise. We say this because we met each other at the time in our lives where space was necessary for healing from past but also recognizing that there is someone special and wouldn’t want to waste any moment without them. The distance helped us really appreciate each other especially whenever we come together, every moment is cherished, every fight is nurtured to understanding and accountability, It has really taught us what true love is. It has taught us patience. We are saying yes to more adventures within, we are saying yes to more adventures with each other. We are saying yes to the little things, the quiet moments, the forever hidden in the everyday with each other.
